# 42 Cub 3D Project ReadMe
# by [bbenidar](https://github.com/bbenidar) && [moudrib](https://github.com/mouadd55)

Welcome to the 42 Cub 3D project! In this project, you will be creating a simple 3D game engine that can render cubes in a 3D environment. This ReadMe file will provide you with important information on how to build and run the project, as well as some optional bonus features.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: Mandatory and Bonus. Please follow the instructions in each section accordingly.

### Mandatory

To build and run the mandatory part of the project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Mandatory
Compile the project using the make command:

```
make
```
Run the compiled program:

```
./cub3D map.cub
```
Replace map.cub with the path to your map file.

The above steps will build and run the mandatory part of the project, allowing you to render a 3D environment with cubes based on the map you provide.

# Bonus
The bonus section includes additional features or improvements to the project. To build and run the bonus part of the project, follow these steps:

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:

```
cd Bonus
```
Compile the bonus project using the make bonus command:

```
make bonus
```
Run the compiled program:
```
./cub3D map_bonus.cub
```

The bonus section may include enhanced graphics, additional gameplay elements, or other improvements beyond the mandatory requirements.

# Map File
The project relies on a map file (e.g., map.cub or map_bonus.cub) to define the 3D environment. Make sure your map file follows the correct format as specified in the project instructions.

# Controls
The controls for navigating the 3D environment are typically defined in the project and may include:

# W: Move forward
# S: Move backward
# A: Strafe left
# D: Strafe right
# Left Arrow: Rotate camera left
# Right Arrow: Rotate camera right
# Esc: Exit the game
# F : to change waoppen
# R : to reload the gun if u shose the ak gun
Please refer to the project's documentation or code comments for specific control details.

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors while building or running the project, please refer to the project documentation or consult with your peers and instructors for assistance.

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You now have the necessary information to build and run the 42 Cub 3D project. Have fun exploring your 3D world and experimenting with the bonus features if you choose to tackle them. Good luck!
